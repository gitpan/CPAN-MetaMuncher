NAME
    CPAN::MetaMuncher - Digest a META.yml

SYNOPSIS
        use CPAN::MetaMuncher;

        # ...
        my $mm = CPAN::MetaMuncher->new(module => $module_name);

        # or, to apply CPAN::MetaMuncher::RPMInfo and get handy rpm methods
        my $mmrpm = CPAN::MetaMuncher->with_traits('RPMInfo')->new(...);

        # ...

DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: This is VERY early code.

    An abstraction layer for META.yml, and possibly others. Right now we
    support the META.yml spec 1.4, though this is likely to be expanded in
    the future.

"GENERIC" METHODS
  has_meta_key
  meta_entry_for
  meta_keys
    Returns a list of all keys used by this META.yml.

  num_meta_keys
  has_meta_keys
TRAITSFOR
    This package can be composed with various traits to allow for additional
    functionality, etc. (Note this is "traits" in the sense of "role layered
    on top of a concrete class" rather than "metaclass role"; see, e.g., the
    TraitFor packages for Catalyst.)

    Traits for CPAN::MetaMuncher live under the CPAN::MetaMuncher::TraitsFor
    namespace.

  RPMInfo
    Additional methods to help construct dependency info in a way RPM can
    understand and use it.

    See CPAN::MetaMuncher::TraitsFor::RPMInfo for details.
